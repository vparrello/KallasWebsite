                    Hello! My name is Christ Anton Kallas II and I grew up in an entrepreneurial household that taught me the importance of bringing meaningful value to everything that I do. My father was a chocolate manufacturer that managed a retail storefront, and my mother ran his marketing. Together they created a thriving business that we were all proud to be a part of. In my career I followed in my motherâ€™s footsteps - I have over ten years of marketing experience managing brand strategy, spearheading innovation, creating media content, outlining go-to-market strategies, performing quantitative analytics, managing P&Ls, and so much more. I have worked with hundreds of years old, multibillion-dollar manufacturing firms as well as with zero-year-old startups, so I can lend support to businesses of any size. In my career I have worked to have a meaningful impact on every project I touch, no matter the size of the firm. For the third largest brewer in the United States, I created and managed a $50M 360-degree media campaign to launch a brand nationally; I have also worked with a budget of $5,000/month to create social media and website content for a startup. No matter the size or complexity of your business, I can help.
